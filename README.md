## Initialization
### AppDelegate

1. Initalise SDK  in **application(_ application: UIAfpplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {** in your Appdelegate class 

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    AckooSDKManager.shared().initSession();
}
```
2. Implement **application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {** in your Appdelegate class or SceneDelegate class

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    AckooSDKManager.shared().continueActivity(userActivity: userActivity)
}
//if you are using scenes
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity) {
    AckooSDKManager.shared().continueActivity(userActivity: userActivity)
}
```


From here you will get information for which product the user has opened you application. 


You can check if the current user is valid AckooSDK user or not by calling below method 
```swift

AckooSDKManager.shared().isUserValidForSDK {
    (activationState) in

    if case .active(let sessionToken) = activationState {
        self.showAlert(title: "Ackoo SDK is Active", message: "sessionToken : \(sessionToken)")
    } else if case .inactive(let errorCode, let errorMessage) = activationState {
        self.showAlert(title: "Ackoo SDK is Inactive", message: "code : \(errorCode), message: \(errorMessage)")
    }
    
}
```
